Consumer complaint narrative
"I have a serious complaint with XXXX XXXX company - I filed a fraud alert on XX/XX/2021 - they sent me a new card and advised they would open an investigation to refund my {$280.00} that was stolen from me because my card was compromised. I mailed their questionaire back in early XXXX one day after I received it. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. I have called several times and been placed on hold for over an hour every time. Today I was transferred to a level 2 helpdesk, Fraud, Customer service. I believe this is very unorganized, under employed organization. It has been 40 business days since I filed my fraud. After waiting for 1 hour and 20 mins today a woman named XXXX helped me and told me it takes 45 business days to complete the fraud complaint. There is no reason anyone should have to sit and listen to hold music for an hour and 20 mins. There should also be a way to email or reach XXXX other than only a telephone number. This is a card company who handles child support payments. It is completely unacceptable. I would like this company to be looked into and improvements made with regard to citizens money and the handling of it."
"On XX/XX/2021 I was on a XXXX XXXX flight when I was given a promotion for a XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card issued by Barklay Bank.

I called Barklay Bank today, XX/XX/2021 to access this promotion. I was told I could not access that offer via telephone and that they were not offering the promotion online either. I received the brochure and there was no written application attached. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and was told no one was available. I believe this to be deceptive advertising. The agent at Barkclay Bank offered me a different promo with different benefits that were different from those listed on the brochure. 

I am attaching a copy of the brochure I received. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. XXXX"
"On XX/XX/19, I purchased flights using my Citibank Costco rewards credit card for {$3500.00}. After the flights were cancelled and I was unable to get a refund from the merchant XXXXXXXX, I disputed the charge. Citibank never contacted me to get additional information and closed the case in the vendor 's favor. On the XX/XX/XXXX statement, we paid the {$3500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX statement, we were charged again the {$3500.00}, an error on Citi 's part. Therefore, Citi has charged me twice. Attempting to resolve this seems to be intentionally difficult. Moreover, the Department of Transportation ( Case # XXXX ) contacted XXXX to refund the money for the tickets which is in process. I have called at least XXXX separate times for an hour each to Citibank to address this situation which is abundantly clear that they made an error. Now, because of their reticence to remedy the situation, I will need to make the full payment to avoid interest charges. Truthfully, I believe that Citibank is intentionally attempting to keep the money and find their business practices unacceptable. I will effectively be out of pocket XXXX {$7000.00} until this is resolved."
